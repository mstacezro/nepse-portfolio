 PHASE 1: Project Structure Setup
Create a root folder for your project

Inside it, create two main folders: one for the backend (backend/) and one for the frontend (frontend/)

Initialize a Git repository (optional but recommended)

✅ PHASE 2: Backend Setup with Django + DRF
Create a virtual environment and initialize a Django project inside backend/

Install required Python packages: Django, DRF, PostgreSQL driver, Celery, Redis, etc.

Create a new Django app (e.g., portfolio)

Set up PostgreSQL database connection in Django settings

Create database models:

User (built-in or custom)

FamilyMember (related to User)

Holding (related to FamilyMember)

Set up Django REST Framework and define serializers, views, and URLs for APIs

Implement JWT-based authentication

Add admin panel entries for your models

✅ PHASE 3: Celery for NEPSE Data Fetching
Set up Celery configuration in your Django project

Connect Redis as the message broker

Write a Celery task to fetch NEPSE live data (API or scraping)

Use Celery Beat to schedule the task every 10 seconds

Store fetched data in cache or database

✅ PHASE 4: Frontend Setup with React
Initialize a React app inside frontend/

Install required packages: Axios, React Router DOM, etc.

Design and implement pages:

Login/Register

Dashboard with:

Family Members

Their Holdings

Live NEPSE data display

Connect React frontend with Django backend using Axios

Handle JWT authentication on the frontend

✅ PHASE 5: Dockerize the Project
Create Dockerfiles for both backend and frontend

Create a docker-compose.yml to run:

Backend (Django + Gunicorn)

Frontend (React)

PostgreSQL

Redis

Celery worker

Celery beat

Add environment variables via .env file

Test the entire system by running docker-compose up

✅ PHASE 6: Testing and Improvements
Run Django migrations and create superuser

Test APIs using Postman or browser

Test periodic NEPSE data fetching

Test React frontend UI & state updates

Add improvements:

Input validation

Loading/error states

Graphs for portfolio value over time

Notifications on price movements
